1. Write a query to count the number of products across all orders received by the
Warehouse system today (the PostgreSQL database).


select count(distinct tbl1.prd) from 
(select a.order_id as ord,b.product_id as prd from orders a inner join order_products b 
on a.order_id = b.order_id where date(a.received) = current_date) tbl1;

2. Given an order_id, how would you find its last GPS coordinates?


select tbl1.ord,tbl1.area from (select a.product_id as prd,a.order_id as ord,b.area as area from order_products a inner join product_locations b 
on a.product_id = b.product_id) tbl1 where tbl1.ord IN ("Given order id");

3. What do you think is the most serious problem among these systems, and why?

As on online retailer site, I could classified the functionality of this site into three categories.
      1. Tracking the transaction
      2. Product catalogue
      3. Delivery system 

from the above categories, i think the following items are Missing.

     1. Payment related information
     2. In-depth info about product
     3. as of an online site. Customer should have contact number/email id to track the order.
     4. Cancel/update the order.

Please note: I am not considering about customer review/feedback. Because we are not doing any data analytics stuffs over here. 
So Ignore those part.

I would give 3 out of 5 for using MySQL as primary database.

Because In Mysql need lot of engineering work to do optimize the performance and scalability.
And also i have the question about data securities and the performance while the network traffic time.

The major problem i could see here is data synchronization between Mysql and POSTGRE. If there is any network failure occur.
We might loss data accuracy. Our delivery system fetch the data from postgre. If any update happens on mysql. It will not reflect in postgre. 
That time delivery system using old data.

To give the proper online retail site by using these system need lot of engineering effect.

4.Why do you think this fictional company chose Redis for their delivery system?
and is it a good choice

I would say its good choice. Because

REDIS is Data Structure Server, provides In memory KEY-VALUE store,
and also have the cache layer and message broken.

REDIS provide high latency to pass the status using PUB/SUB.
